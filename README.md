# Mars Colony Hybrid App

### Description:
A web-based app for Earth colonists exploring Mars using AngularJS.

* Implement basic ajax GET and POST requests using Angularâ€™s $http service to: Save a new colonists information, save a new alien encounter, fetch a list of recent encounters, remove a colonist from the colony, determine if a colonist has already registered, create a new ailen type, create a new encounter
* Implement swipe-left and swipe-right navigation and animated page transitions.

### Stuff used to make this:

 * HTML/CSS
 * AngularJS
 * ngTouch, ngAnimate, ngCookies
 * JSON API
 * SASS
 * Gulp Automation Task
 * Flexbox

##### My thought on the project :+1: :

Mars Colony App was a very fun, creative project to show the power of AngularJS framework, much less code, and it feels like an app. I also had the chance to work with JSON API again.
